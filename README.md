# Face-Recognition-System
A Python-based Face Recognition system using OpenCV and face detection libraries. This project allows you to detect and recognize human faces in real time or from images.
## Description

This project uses OpenCV with Haar Cascades and/or `face_recognition` library (built on top of dlib) to recognize faces. It's useful for building attendance systems, basic biometric verification, or even fun AI camera filters.

## Features

- Detect and recognize human faces
- Real-time recognition via webcam
- Add new faces to the database
- Logs or alerts recognized individuals
- Easy to customize for projects like attendance or security

## Project Structure

├── dataset/ # Folder to store training face images
├── recognizer/ # Folder to save trained models

├── haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
├── train.py # Script to train the recognizer
├── recognize.py # Script to recognize faces via webcam

└── README.md

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy

If using face_recognition:
pip install face_recognition

How to Use

1. Collect Face Data
python collect.py

Follow the prompts to save images of faces into the dataset folder.

3. Train the Model
python train.py

This generates a model (trainer.yml) using the face samples.

5. Run Face Recognition
python recognize.py

Opens webcam and displays recognized faces with their names (or IDs).

Example Output

Detected face: dhivakar
Or with bounding boxes and names over the webcam feed.

Customize

You can adapt this code for:
Attendance systems
Smart door locks
Personalized experiences in apps
